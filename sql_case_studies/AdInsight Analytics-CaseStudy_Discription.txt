AdInsight Analytics – SQL Case Study
AdInsight Analytics is a digital marketing agency that helps businesses analyze trends in online ad click behavior among their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the AdInsight Analytics team, who then aggregate interest-based metrics and produce a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

These datasets include the composition and rankings of different interests, showing the percentage of a client's customers who interacted with online content related to specific interests over each month.

You have been given the task of analyzing aggregated metrics for one of AdInsight’s major clients and generating high-level insights about the customers and their interests.

Available Data
This case study contains two datasets that you will use to answer the analysis questions.

1. Interest Metrics
This table includes aggregated interest data for a major client. Each row represents the performance of a specific interest_id, measured through customer interactions (clicks and engagements) with targeted advertising content.

_month	_year	month_year	interest_id	composition	index_value	ranking	percentile_ranking
7	2018	07-2018	32486	11.89	6.19	1	99.86
7	2018	07-2018	6106	9.93	5.31	2	99.73
...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...

Example Interpretation:

For the first row:

In July 2018, 11.89% of the client’s customers engaged with content related to interest_id = 32486.

The index_value of 6.19 means this engagement rate is 6.19 times higher than the average across all other clients in the same month.

The ranking and percentile_ranking reflect how this interest ranks compared to others for the same month.

2. Interest Map
This table links interest_id values to human-readable interest categories and summaries. You’ll need to join this table with the interest_metrics table to interpret the interests by name and description.

id	interest_name	interest_summary	created_at	last_modified
1	Fitness Enthusiasts	Consumers using fitness tracking apps and websites.	2016-05-26 14:57:59	2018-05-23 11:30:12

You will use these tables to analyze user interests, identify trends, and derive insights to inform client marketing strategies.
