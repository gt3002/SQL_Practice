--## Data Exploration
--1. What day of the week does each week_date fall on?
--→ Find out which weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) each sales week starts on.
select distinct week_date, DATENAME(weekday, week_date)

--2. What range of week numbers are missing from the dataset?
select distinct week_number
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales
order by week_number;

with week_num as(
select 1 as w
union all
select w + 1
from week_num
where w < 53
)
select w as missing_weeks from week_num
where w not in( select distinct week_number from dmart.qt.weekly_sales)

--3. How many purchases were made in total for each year?
--→ Count the total number of transactions for every year in the dataset.
select calendar_year, count(transactions) as total_purchase
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales
group by calendar_year
order by calendar_year;

--4. How much was sold in each region every month?
--→ Show total sales by region, broken down by month.
select region, month_number, sum(cast(sales as bigint)) total_sales
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales
group by region, month_number
order by region

--5. How many transactions happened on each platform?
--→ Count purchases separately for the online store and the physical store.
select platform, count(transactions) num_of_transactions
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales
group by platform;

--6. What share of total sales came from Offline vs Online each month?
--→ Compare the percentage of monthly sales from the physical store vs. the online store.

select month_number, sum(cast(sales as bigint)) sales_offline
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales

from sales_offline sf join sales_online so

--7. What percentage of total sales came from each demographic group each year?
--→ Break down annual sales by customer demographics (e.g., age or other groupings).

select calendar_year, sum(cast(sales as bigint)) sales_c

--8. Which age groups and demographic categories had the highest sales in physical stores?
--→ Find out which age and demographic combinations contribute most to Offline-Store sales.
select TOP 1

sum(cast(sales as bigint)) sales_total
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales
where platform  ='Offline-store' and age_band != 'unknown'
group by age_band, demographic
order by sales_total desc;

--9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to calculate average purchase size by year and platform? If not, how should we do it?
--→ Check if the avg_transaction column gives us correct yearly average sales per transaction for Offline 
--vs Online. If it doesn't, figure out how to calculate it manually (e.g., by dividing total sales by total transactions).

select calendar_year, platform, avg(avg_transaction) as avg_purchase
from dmart.qt.weekly_sales
group by calendar_year, platform;

select calendar_year, platform, round(cast(sum(cast(sales as bigint)) as float)/
cast(sum(transactions) as float), 2) as avg_purchase

--### Pre-Change vs Post-Change Analysis
